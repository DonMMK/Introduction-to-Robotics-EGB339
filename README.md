### Learning outcomes
-   Choose and integrate hardware components for a robotic system.
-   Design and synthesize simple software control systems for individual robotic joints.
-   Develop and implement mathematical models of multi-link robots to describe the relationship between individual joints and the position and velocity of the robot's end effector.
-   Apply computer vision techniques to control an intelligent robot.
-   Design and report the development of practical robotic systems that incorporate all of the above.
